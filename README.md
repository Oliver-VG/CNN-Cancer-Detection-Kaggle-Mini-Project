# CNN Cancer Detection – Mini Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting cancer in histopathology images using convolutional neural networks.

## Contents
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Building PyTorch datasets and dataloaders  
- Training image classifiers (ResNet-based)  
- Evaluating performance with AUC and accuracy  
- Generating predictions for Kaggle submission  

## Dataset
The notebook uses the Histopathologic Cancer Detection dataset provided on Kaggle.  
Images and labels must be downloaded from the competition page and extracted before running the notebook.

## Usage
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.  
2. Open the notebook `Module-3_CNN-Cancer-Detection.ipynb`.  
3. Run all cells step‑by‑step to train the model and create a submission file.

## Notes
- GPU acceleration is recommended.  
- The notebook includes running times, EDA, and model evaluation plots.
